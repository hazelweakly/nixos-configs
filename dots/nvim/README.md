# Things I need to do:

## Enhancements

- Figure out how to get everything related to direnv working better
  - LSP
  - Direnv choking if I start typing during async or whatever
- Make a bunch of the stuff (like null-ls) smartly configured based on existance of binaries.
  - remove more binaries from neovim.nix and make it more minimal. Its closure is currently massive.
  - add wget, apparently
- Purge out some macos included stuff from the neovim path? maybe?
- re-evaluate targets.vim again
- keybind of : doesn't pop up in the right spot.
- Better insert bindings for commandline and telescope prompt?
-  nerdsnipe on the packer config again
