# nixos-configs
Configurations for my NixOS systems (currently just my laptop)

Very WIP.

I'm building these with a focus on minimal abstraction and redirection until the need arises.
Essentially, I'm writing the ugly solution and waiting until it's painful before cleaning it up.
This is in hopes that these files and git history can be useful to people just starting with NixOS and trying to make sense of some of the _very_ complicated configuration setups out there.
