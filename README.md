# nixos-configs

Configurations for my NixOS and macOS systems (work/home laptops)

## Design philosophy

- Avoid channels wherever possible
- System overlays should be available in all nix CLI tools
- Full system can be created from a single command with no incremental bootstrapping needed
- Whenever possible, have declarative configuration of environment.
  - Try to keep configuration in the natural language of that environment. (eg don't fully embed vimrc into nix)
- System configuration should be buildable from CI

## Install Instructions
